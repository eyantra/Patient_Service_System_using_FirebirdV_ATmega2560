\section{Problem Statement and Description}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{frame}{Patient Service System - Problem Statement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Automatic attendants which would serve patients' requests such as supplying water or patient specific medicines etc.
\item These attendants should be summonable using an easy to use interface by the patients.
\item The patients should be served in a fair-share manner and the requests should satisfy bounded wait.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Description}
\begin{frame}{Patient Service System - Description}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each patient has a TV remote with which he/she can send a request to the server.
\item On receiving a request, the server sends a bot to serve the patients' requests. This is communicated to the patient via an SMS.
\item The server ensures reliable communication (via Zigbee) with all the serving bots and the patient controller.
\item The server design must be scalable to serve a large number of patients, and must be free of deadlocks, race conditions and must have maximum concurrency.
\item If a bot is blocked on it's path to the patient, then the server informs the security about the block, via an SMS.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Functional Requirements and Execution}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{frame}{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Central Server
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient requests should be communicated to the centralized server through a wireless medium.
\item  The centralized server would send attendants to serve the patients' requests or communicate to doctors about the urgency of the situation (through SMS or otherwise), whichever applicable.
\item  It should run a scheduling algorithm to manage the robotic attendants so as to serve the patients in a least possible time.
\end{itemize}
\item Robotic Attendants
\begin{itemize}
\item  The robot should follow a fixed path indicated by white lines.
\item  It should stop in presence of an obstruction and alarm the guards about its prolonged obstructed movement and send an SMS (through the server) to inform the security.
\item  It should be able to serve multiple patients, on request.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Work Execution (2/2)}

\section{Innovations, Challenges and Solutions}
\subsection{Innovations and Challenges}
\begin{frame}{Innovation and Challenges (1/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Server runs in Ubuntu. Bot AVR-programming done in Ubuntu.
\item Zigbee communication using \emph{Java}.
\item MySQL database. Makes the project scalable for large number of patients.
\item Correction and Recovery while following the white line. Smooth running of the bot, (without any extra squares added at intersections).
\item Polling based communication implemented to avoid interference between serving bot and patient bot.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Innovation and Challenges (2/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum parallelism and concurrency to avoid time/resource wastage. (Multithreading which is not concurrent like pthread, but actually parallel).
\item Testing everything and making the design modular so that the different parts have least to do with one another. Done using virtual simulation of bots.
\item Ensuring no deadlock between multiple bots.
\item Getting TV remote to work using a Protocol independent learning based algorithm.
\item Sending SMS to phone.
\item Efficient Scheduling Algorithm.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Modular Testing}
\begin{frame}{Modular Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing multiple Zigbee client - single Zigbee server protocol.
\item Virtual bot simulation and testing of server.
\item Testing for deadlocks and race conditions.
\item Server independent testing of serving bots.
\item Independent TV remote testing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Combined Testing}
\begin{frame}{Combined Testing}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Correct patient-request is served by the attendant.
\item Attendant stops in presence of obstruction and beeps in case of prolonged obstruction.
\item 6 patient controllers using TV remote.
\item Simultaneous requests allowed (served in fair-share FIFO order).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Code Reusability}
\begin{frame}{Code Reusability}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Server code : Completely object oriented (Java).
\item Modular Design : Modules independent of each other, hence can be changed without changing others.
\begin{itemize}
\item A different arena can be stored by changing \emph{Graph.java}.
\item Polling protocol can be changed by changing \emph{PollingThread.java}.
\item \emph{Properties} file stores all user dependent constants that can be changed without going through/compiling the code.
\end{itemize}
\item Server is bot-hardware independent. Relies on only a serial communication protocol (not necessarily Zigbee) with the bot.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Directions}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Can be adapted to suit hospitals like Tata Memorial Hospital.
\item Attendants can be suited to check patient condition (such as glucose bottle levels) and take appropriate action (refill the glucose bottle).
\item Can be used to help in house-hold activities (such as watering plants, etc.). TV remote based interface makes it convenient to use.
\end{itemize}
